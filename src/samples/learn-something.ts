This is a practice that encourages self-reflection, mindfulness, and awareness of one's thoughts and feelings.

To explain this in an easier-to-understand way, the Four Noble Truths are essentially saying that life is full of suffering, but we can reduce our suffering by letting go of our attachments and following the Eightfold Path. This Eightfold Path involves things like engaging in ethical behavior, developing mindfulness and wisdom, and cultivating compassion.',
